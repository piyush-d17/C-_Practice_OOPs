In C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses the concept of "objects" to organize and structure code. C++ is an extension of the C programming language and includes additional features to support object-oriented programming. Here are the key principles of OOP in C++:
1.**Polymorphism**:
*Polymorphism* allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects, and it includes two types: compile-time (static) polymorphism and runtime (dynamic) polymorphism.
2.**Inheritance**:
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The class that is inherited from is called the base class or parent class, and the class that inherits is called the derived class or child class.
3.**Abstraction**:
Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they possess. It allows programmers to focus on relevant details while hiding unnecessary complexities.
4.**Encapsulation**:
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (class). It helps in hiding the internal details of a class from the outside world and only exposing what is necessary.
